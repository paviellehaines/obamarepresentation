# Obama the Descriptive Representative

This project seeks to evaluate Obama's performance as a descriptive represetnative for African Americans compared to his precessors. It does so using (1) State of the Union Speeches to measure racial rhetoric and (2) budget data to measure policy efforts on behalf of African Americans. For the protection of intellectual property, the data files are not provided. However, the code shows the statistical approaches used. They include linear regression, t-tests, interrupted time series analysis, and forecasting. In addition to the R code, figures are included to show the results of the analysis. They suggest that although Obama spoke about racial issues no more (or even less) than his predcessors, he made concerted policy efforts in the intersts of the African American community. This suggests that Obama may have sought to "deracialize" his governance. In other words, he was spending without saying.

Replication File for Obama the Descriptive Representative.r: This file contains the code used in all analyses. Multiple data sets are imported, combined, or aggregated prior to the anlayses. The associated figures were generated using this code.

Figure 1: This figure shows how Obama's discussion of poverty (which is a serious problem in the African American community) compares to previous presidents. It also compares how frequently he spoke about the poor versus the middle class. the results show that Obama talked about the poor far less than most presidents, but the middle class much more.

Figure 2: This figure shows how Obama's discussion of civil rights compared to his predcessors'. He spoke far less in his firts term and about as much as previous democrats in his second term. In relative terms, Obama did not neglect civil rights issues in his rhetoric. But neither was he a public champion.

Figure 3: This shows yearly propsed anti-poverty spending from Nixon to Obama. It increases sharply under the Obama administration. This increase cannot be attributed to either the ACA or the economic recovery spending, since the spending on these bills were approved seperately from the budget process.

Figure 4: This figure shows yearly proposed civil rights spending from Nixon to Obama. There is a slight, but marked increase under the Obama administration.

Figure 5: This figure shows average proposed anti-poverty spending by administration.

Figure 6: This figure shows average proposed civil rights spending by administration.

Table 1: This figure shows the results of a regression analysis for presidential rhetoric. Controls are included for potentially confounding factors (e.g. presidents might talk more about poverty during an economic downturn, not because they are personally disposed to adressing it as an issue).

Table 2: This figures shows the results of an interrupted time series analysis for presidential spending. Controls are included for potentially confounding factors (e.g. Obama's greater spending may simply be the product of gradual increases over time).
